# EXP-1-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:

• Start by understanding the basics of Generative AI and its working principles.

• Study the architectural models behind Generative AI (RNN, LSTM, Transformers).

• Analyze the working of Transformers with attention, encoder-decoder mechanisms, and
  pre-training.
  
• Explore real-world applications of Generative AI (text, image, audio, video generation).

• Investigate the scaling laws of LLMs and their effect on performance, generalization, and
  efficiency.
  
• Summarize findings into a structured report format (concepts → architecture → applications →
  scaling impact).
